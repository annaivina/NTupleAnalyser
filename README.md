# NTupleAnalyser
The code is in rel 21 (using CMake) and it helps to analyse the Tuples coming from the HGamCore package.

It selects the events based on the isPAssed selector (the clean photons coming from the PV)
and it categorises the events into the c-tagged and non--c--tagged categories.

The flat root files are ready to be used in the Fitting package
